    "Hi solveit! I am Chuck, and I am working with you today! I'm know basic Python, LLM prompt programming and engineering, and I enjoy learning new things. When writing code for me, please follow fast.ai coding style: avoid comments; place single line if/loop/etc constructs on the same line; use concise variable names where appropriate. Follow the style you will see in my messages, as we work on this dialogue together. Please follow the Anthropic prompt engineering recommendations and utilize patterns from the Anthropic Agent Guidance. I am interested in extending cosette for building agentic workflows and approaches in a Solve It environment. We want to do this using the Fast.ai/solveit approach using literate exploratory programming. Are you ready?"

    "        3. Error Handling:\n",

    "Below is a summary of strengths in your existing Agent class, along with recommended improvements to align even more closely with Anthropic’s patterns (like prompt chaining workflows vs. fully “agentic” loops) and to ensure consistency with Cosette’s internal handling of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths\n",
    "\t1.\tClear Role and System Prompt\n",
    "You expose role and system in a straightforward way. This is good for quickly creating domain-specific or multi-role agents.\n",
    "\t2.\tSupport for “Workflow” vs. “Agentic”\n",
    "        -\trun(prompt) is perfect for single-turn or step-by-step workflow patterns.\n",
    "\t    -\trun_with_tools(prompt) automatically handles multi-step tool usage internally with Cosette’s toolloop, which aligns with the “agentic” pattern where the LLM decides the next step or whether to invoke tools.\n",
    "\t3.\tConversation History and Pruning\n",
    "You keep a separate self.messages list and have _prune_history to manage the conversation length. This is helpful for controlling context window usage.\n",
    "\t4.\tLogging\n",
    "Your _setup_logging() approach helps track prompt usage in real time, which is essential for debugging and ensuring traceability.\n",
    "\t5.\tshow()\n",
    "A user-friendly way to inspect the agent’s state, role, tools, and conversation. This is very “fast.ai-style,” enabling an iterative development approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "These design choices already reflect many best practices from Anthropic’s Building Effective Agents guidance:\n",
    "- Start simple with a minimal class.\n",
    "- Provide composable building blocks (basic single-turn calls, tool-driven loops).\n",
    "- Keep your agent’s roles and tools clearly documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Unify or Clarify Conversation State with Cosette\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Issue\n",
    "You store conversation messages in two places:\n",
    "-\tself.messages: A Python list you append to in run() / run_with_tools().\n",
    "-\tself.chat.messages: Cosette’s internal conversation log (because Chat also stores messages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Problem\n",
    "These two can get out of sync. For instance, self.chat(...) automatically updates self.chat.messages behind the scenes, and you’re also manually appending messages to self.messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested Approaches\n",
    "\t1.\tRely entirely on self.chat.messages for conversation history. Then self.show() and _prune_history() would operate directly on self.chat.messages.\n",
    "```pyhon\n",
    "def _prune_history(self):\n",
    "    if self.memory_size is not None and self.memory_size > 0:\n",
    "        if len(self.chat.messages) > (self.memory_size + 1):\n",
    "            system_msg = self.chat.messages[0]\n",
    "            relevant = self.chat.messages[-self.memory_size:]\n",
    "            self.chat.messages = [system_msg] + relevant\n",
    "```\n",
    "And in run(), you don’t need to append to self.messages; Cosette does it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\tKeep your separate self.messages but do not rely on self.chat.messages at all, i.e., pass ephemeral conversations to Cosette each time. This requires re-building the Cosette messages on each call. However, you lose some of Cosette’s nice stateful chat features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simpler approach is usually to trust Cosette’s state and prune + display from there. That way you never have to manually maintain a second conversation log.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Make run_multi_step() (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you want a pattern like:\n",
    "\n",
    "response = self.chat(prompt)  # triggers tool call(s)\n",
    "final = self.chat()           # finalize after tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You have run_with_tools() for fully agentic multi-step loops, but you might also add a two-call function if your team likes that approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def run_multi_step(self, prompt:str, **kwargs):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    1) Calls `self.chat(prompt)` once\n",
    "    2) Calls `self.chat()` again to finalize any pending tool usage\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    self._prune_history()\n",
    "    first = self.chat(prompt, **kwargs)\n",
    "    second = self.chat()\n",
    "    return contents(second)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This matches the “half-scripted, half-agentic” approach your earlier prototypes used.\n",
    "(If you don’t need it, feel free to skip.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Add a max_steps Argument to run_with_tools()\n",
    "\n",
    "For truly agentic usage, the LLM might call tools repeatedly. To prevent infinite loops or runaway costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def run_with_tools(self, prompt: str, max_steps=5, **kwargs) -> str:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    response = self.chat.toolloop(prompt, max_steps=max_steps, **kwargs)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is especially relevant for “autonomous agents,” aligning with Anthropic’s recommendation to set a stopping condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Workflow Patterns: Encourage Composition Over Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re already well-situated to build more advanced workflows (like routing, parallelization, evaluator-optimizer loops) by:\n",
    "-\tCalling self.run() multiple times in a Python function.\n",
    "-\tUsing different Agents for different roles or “workers.”\n",
    "-\tCombining them in an orchestrator function or script.\n",
    "\n",
    "No changes to your Agent class are necessarily required for this—just document how to do it externally. For example, a “prompt-chaining workflow” might look like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def prompt_chaining_workflow(agent: Agent, user_request: str):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Outline\n",
    "    outline = agent.run(f\"Please outline the solution for: {user_request}\")\n",
    "    # Step 2: Check or transform the outline in code\n",
    "    # Step 3: Expand\n",
    "    expansion = agent.run(f\"Expand the outline:\\n{outline}\")\n",
    "    return expansion\n",
    "```\n",
    "And a “voting” approach might do multiple calls to agent.run() in parallel. Your Agent class is already flexible enough for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Consider an Orchestrator Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a more advanced “orchestrator-workers” approach (like Anthropic’s mention), you might define a specialized OrchestratorAgent:\n",
    "\t•\tDifferent system prompt: e.g. \"You are an orchestrator. You can break tasks into subtasks and assign them to specialized agents.\"\n",
    "\t•\tA custom method that, when used in a fully agentic way, calls a Python function “dispatch_subtask” as a tool. That function in turn calls other sub-agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can get fancy, but that’s the general idea if you want to handle tasks that dynamically spawn multiple sub-requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "\t1.\tUnify conversation logs—pick either self.chat.messages or self.messages, not both. Using Cosette’s built-in state is easiest.\n",
    "\t2.\tOptionally add a simpler run_multi_step() or “two-step” method if you like that pattern.\n",
    "\t3.\tAdd a max_steps parameter to run_with_tools() for safety in agentic loops.\n",
    "\t4.\tLeverage Agent.run(...) calls to do prompt-chaining, routing, parallelization, or any other “workflow” in standard Python functions—no major changes needed.\n",
    "\t5.\tIf you want advanced orchestrator/worker patterns, create a specialized agent or define a code-level orchestrator that calls multiple Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tweaks, your Agent is fully aligned with both Cosette’s best practices and Anthropic’s recommended approach for building agentic systems."
